Welcome to Goofygiraffe06's Blog!

Hi there! I'm Rahul Narsingipyta a.k.a. Goofygiraffe06. Currently a student, I'm deeply passionate about web and network penetration testing. My days are mostly spent dabbling with Linux, and I've grown fond of the open-source community. 

I created this blog to document and share my notes, write-ups, and experiences. It's a space where I'll discuss techniques, challenges, and my personal insights into the world of penetration testing and open source.

And if there's one thing I've come to realize, it's this:

!!!
"You don't truly understand something until you've broken it... and then put it back together."

## Achivements

1. Our team placed 18th position in Patriot CTF '23 hosted by Mason Competitive Cyber.
1. Found a critical vulnerability in an Indian Government website and got acknowledged by NCIIPC (National Critical Information Protection Center).

Thanks for stopping by!
